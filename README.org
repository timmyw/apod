#+TITLE: APOD utilities

Very simple util to bring down the most recent NASA Astronomy Picture
of the Day, with some shell scripts to set the picture as the desktop
wallpaper.

* Build/install

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
go build # or go install
#+END_SRC

The library and executable are in separate src directories, so to
install the executable (~apod~):
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
go install apod/apod.go
#+END_SRC

That will install it to `$GOBIN`.

or, if you don't have ~GOBIN~ set:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
GOBIN=$GOPATH/bin go install apod/apod.go
#+END_SRC


* Usage

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
apod/apod --help
Usage of apod/apod:
  -output string
    	Output directory (default ".")
#+END_SRC
